## WeatherDash assignment

For this asssignment, I had to dynamically create a weather dashboard using javascript, jquery, html, and css.

My biggest challenge was creating the for loop to iterate through the objects in the weather array. Especially for the icons. I am grateful that with a little bit of help, I was able to correct the bugs that got me a bad grade at first. Hopefully, this time around the grade will be better :)
